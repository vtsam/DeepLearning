# The datafiles contain two representations of jets: an image-representation and
# a representation as a list of particles. The goal is to determine whether the 
# jet comes from a quark, gluon, W, Z or t (top-quark). 

# The files are saved as h5-files. These can be dealt with in python using
# h5py. To construct graphs, we use matplotlib.

import h5py
import glob
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# First import the data from github. To use shell commands, start the command 
# line with !

! git clone https://github.com/vtsam/jetdata.git

# Show the datafiles present on the git page

! ls jetdata

# Now select one of the files and show its contents

testFile = 'jetdata/jetImage_7_100p_10000_20000.h5'
f = h5py.File(testFile)
print(list(f.keys()))

# 'jetConstituentList': list of the particles in the jet. For each of these particles, some relevant quantities are stored
# 'particleFeatureNames': names of the quantities contained in 'jetConstituentList'
# 'jetImage': image representation of the jet
# 'jetImageECAL': ECAL-only image representation of the jet (ECAL stands for electromagnetic calorimeter, which is a device to measure energies of photons and electrons)
# 'jetImageHCAL': HCAL-only image representation of the jet (HCAL stands for hadronic calorimeter, which is a device to measure energies of neutral and charged hadrons)
# 'jets': name of dataset under consideration
# 'jetFeatureNames': names of quantities contained in 'jets'

# Let's take a look at the features of the jets. We see that the list contains 59 elements. The first 53 are the discriminating quantities; the last ones represent
# the ground truth (ie whether the jet comes from gluons, quarks, W, Z or t)

#
# [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] for gluons
# [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] for quarks
# [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] for Ws
# [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] for Zs
# [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] for tops
#
# These also define the target for the classification problem

# Finally, let's take a look at the particle-list representation.

particleData = f.get("jetConstituentList")
print(particleData.shape)

# The dataset has shape (10000,100,16): We have 10000 samples; only keep the first 100 particles with highest p_T and keep track of 16 features.

# Analogously to the image-representation, we can also here plot all features in a histogram. We leave this as an exercise.
